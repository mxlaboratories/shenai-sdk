# Shen.AI SDK

This repository contains integration examples of Shen.AI SDK for all supported platforms.

Please see readme files in the relevant example directory for quickstart instructions and customization notes.

## Developer Portal

For more information and SDK documentation please visit the Shen.AI Developer Portal. Documentation for version 2 of the SDK is available at:

- [developer.shen.ai](https://developer.shen.ai)

You'll need to download the SDK from the Developer Portal and place it in the relevant example directory in order to run the example. You'll also need an API key that can be accessed on the Developer Portal.

## Supported platforms

Shen.AI SDK currently supports the following platforms:

- [Flutter](./examples/flutter/) (both iOS and Android)
- [Android](./examples/android/)
- [iOS](./examples/ios/) (Swift/Obj-C)
- [Web](./examples/web/)

Code examples and apps can be found under `examples` in subdirectories corresponding to the platforms.

## SDK Playground

To easily see what methods are available in the SDK, you can use the **SDK Web Playground**. You can either build it yourself from the [playground](./playground) directory or use the hosted version at [playground.shen.ai](https://playground.shen.ai). You'll need an active Web API key in either case.
