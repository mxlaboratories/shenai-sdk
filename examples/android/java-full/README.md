# Shen.AI SDK Android extended example

This is a extended Android/Java example for Shen.AI SDK.

To run the example, you'll need to download the Android SDK from the Developer Portal and place it in the `libs` directory.

You'll also need an API key (and optionally a user identifier) that can be generated on the Developer Portal. Update [`ExampleConfig.java`](./src/main/java/ExampleConfig.java#L3) with your values before running the sample.
